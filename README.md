thanks for visiting this repo. In this repo, we are going to talk about how we can combine two problems and solve them through one architecture. I use autoencoder both for removing noise from image and then segmentation mask prediction. 

### What's the highlight?
1. I use very naive and simple examples to demonstrate which would likely won't work for any real-world applications. Because I am running them less than 3 minutes on a CPU to train.
2. I write good-code here and best practices.
3. Each are aimed to be beginner friendly and easy-to-started.
